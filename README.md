# AccelAlert - An IoT Based Accident Detection System

Vehicle accidents are a major concern globally, leading to significant injuries and fatalities each year. The current reliance on manual reporting methods, such as witness calls and self-reports, often results in delayed emergency response times. These delays can be critical, especially in severe accidents where immediate medical intervention is necessary to save lives and reduce the severity of injuries. 

Additionally, in remote or less-trafficked areas, accidents may remain unnoticed for extended periods, further exacerbating the problem. This issue impacts all road users, including drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, posing a significant public safety concern. Timely and efficient detection and reporting of accidents are crucial to ensure prompt emergency response, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and save lives. 

Addressing this problem can lead to enhanced safety on roads, quicker medical interventions, and potentially lower fatality rates.
